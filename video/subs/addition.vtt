00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:02.734
Ok we are going to try and add two numbers together.

2
00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:05.878
These numbers are going to be something like this

3
00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:12.118
486 plus 123. Pretty simple?

4
00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:14.341
First of all we start with the units column.

5
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:18.197
So we add 6 and 3 is 9.

6
00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:20.437
Then 8 and 2 is equal to 10.

7
00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.014
Which makes it complicated because we can't put a 10 here.

8
00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:27.424
So we put a zero there and we carry the one over to the next column.

9
00:00:27.424 --> 00:00:30.000
Then we've got 4 plus 1 is equal to 5 plus the one we carried over makes 6.
