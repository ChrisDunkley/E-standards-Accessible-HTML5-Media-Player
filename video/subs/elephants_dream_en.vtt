00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:22.705
the head snarlers.

5
00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:26.340
Everything is safe, perfectly safe. Emo?

00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:49.263
Are you hurt?

10
00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:54.460
I don't think so. You?

11
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.377
I'm OK. Get up. Emo, it's not safe here.

12
00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:03.769
Let's go.

13
00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.646
What's next?

You're not paying attention!

27
00:02:51.313 --> 00:02:54.979
I just want to answer the phone.

28
00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.368
Emo - look - I mean listen.

[Animal noises]

30
00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:03.201
You have to learn to listen.

31
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:07.367
This is not some game. You - I mean we -

32
00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:10.407
we could easily die out here.

33
00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:14.783
Listen, listen to the sounds of the machine.

Don't you ever get tired of this?

41
00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:35.868
Tired!? Emo - the machine is like - like clockwork.

42
00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:40.864
One move out of place and you're ground to a pulp.

43
00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:45.959
Pulp Emo! Is that what you want?

Emo: your goal in life! Pulp?!

00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:44.868
Emo, close your eyes.

00:05:44.868 --> 00:05:45.462
Why?

48
00:05:45.462 --> 00:05:46.346
Now!

00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:52.765
OK

Good.

51
00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:02.203
What do you see at your left side, Emo?

52
00:06:02.203 --> 00:06:05.126
Well - nothing.

53
00:06:05.126 --> 00:06:06.785
Really?

No - nothing at all.

And at your right. What do you see at your right side Emo?

57
00:06:13.288 --> 00:06:17.273
The same, Proog. Exactly the same.

58
00:06:17.273 --> 00:06:18.505
Nothing.

59
00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:20.202

00:06:43.785 --> 00:06:45.731
Can we go here?

63
00:06:45.731 --> 00:06:48.907
There? It isn't safe Emo.

64
00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:50.710
But...

65
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.410
Trust me, it's not.

66
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.035
Well maybe I could g...

67
00:06:55.035 --> 00:06:56.027
No.

No! NO!

70
00:07:01.492 --> 00:07:04.563
Any further questions, Emo?

71
00:07:04.563 --> 00:07:06.043
No.

72
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:11.117
Emo.

73
00:07:11.117 --> 00:07:12.201
Yeah?

74

Emo why? Emo why?

75
00:07:15.707 --> 00:07:19.118
Why can't you see the beauty of this place?

76
00:07:19.118 --> 00:07:24.740
The way it works. How... how perfect it is.

77
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.645
No, Proog. I don't see.

78
00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:31.740
I don't see because there's nothing there.

79
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.989
And why should I trust my life to something that isn't there?

80
00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:37.191
Can you tell me that?

Emo...

88
00:07:52.823 --> 00:07:55.979
No - Emo! It's a trap.

89
00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:58.042
Then it's a trap.

On the left side you can see the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

How's that for a trap?

No Emo.

The Colossus of Rhodes!

No!
